# Meteorstorm - control the ship to avoid the meteors.

### This is my first web project I made for exercising skills.

### A simple game created with HTML, CSS, Javascript with a bit of jQuery.

#### Main features:
* Movement for mouse and touchscreen devices
* Function for animate and random falling meteors
* Score counter 
* Collision detection

#### To fix:
* RWD of meteor elements on big screens (above 15")
* Touchmove on Safari Mobile

[Click to play ](https://davidex1.github.io/meteorstorm/index.html) in browser
